Description: Most image sliders that you see around the Web are powered by JavaScript or a JavaScript library like JQuery. We will build a fully functional image slider with pure CSS. We will have thumbnails which when clicked, make the bigger image slide into place. We will use CSS animation/keyframes to achieve this.

Features/Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, Animation, Keyframes, z-index & Positioning
